I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Washington State University, advised by Professor Jana Doppa. My research interests lie in the broad fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, with a focus on developing efficient learning algorithms to enhance offline optimization methods. This work is motivated by the real-world challenges faced by scientists and engineers in various domains. Prior to joining WSU, I received my engineering degree in Signals and Systems from the "Ã‰cole Polytechnique de Tunisie" in Tunisia.
